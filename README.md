## In order to convert this repo back into a Macro-Enabled Workbook:
  * Clone the repo or download & unzip
  * Find and delete this file
  * At the root level (i.e. do not zip the parent folder), add all files/folders to a zip file
  * Rename the file from *xxxx*.**zip** to *xxxx*.**xlsm**

## To add XLSX / XLSM files to version control:
  * Make a copy of the file
  * Rename it from *xxxx*.**xlsx** or *xxxx*.**xlsm** to *xxxx*.**zip**
  * Unzip the file
  * Add to version control

This method of zipping/unzipping Excel files won't work with **XLS** files (old money) or **XLSB** files (Binary based encoding, not XML based encoding).
